## ðŸ“œ Description
object-pool-template is a simple tool for managing memory efficiently in C++. It uses templates and `std::vector` to create an object pool. This project began as a student effort to learn the ins and outs of memory management and object reuse.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
Follow these easy steps to download and run the application. No programming knowledge is necessary.

### 1. System Requirements
- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Disk Space**: At least 10 MB
- **Memory**: 512 MB of RAM
- **C++ Compiler**: For advanced users who want to modify the code, a C++ compiler is recommended.

### 2. Download & Install

1. Go to the [Releases Page](https://github.com/ThiefOfCoding/object-pool-template/releases).
2. Find the latest version (v1.0).
3. Click on the download link for your operating system.
4. Follow the installation instructions specific to your platform.

## ðŸ”§ Features
- **Generic Object Pool**: Efficiently manage multiple objects in memory.
- **Memory Reuse**: Avoid frequent allocations and deallocations, which can slow down your application.
- **Easy to Understand**: Designed with a simple structure to help beginners grasp memory management concepts.

## ðŸ“Š How It Works
The object pool maintains a list of available objects. When you need an object, it provides one from the pool. When you're done using it, you return it to the pool for future use. This reduces the need for constant memory allocation.

## ðŸ’» Code Example
Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use this object pool in your application:

```cpp
#include "ObjectPool.h"

int main() {
    ObjectPool<MyClass> pool;
    
    MyClass* obj = pool.acquire();
    // Use obj...
    
    pool.release(obj);
    return 0;
}
```
This example shows how to acquire and release objects using the pool. Adjust it according to your needs!
