# ObjectPool (C++ Template Class)

A simple and generic **Object Pool** implementation in C++ using templates. Built as a learning project to understand memory management and object reuse patterns in C++.

This object pool uses a `std::vector` as a stack to manage reusable objects efficiently. You can hook **any object type** to it using templates (`template<typename Object>`).

> Made by a student learning C++, open to feedback and improvements!
---

## Why Use This?

- Efficiently reuse objects without constant memory allocation/deallocation.
- Great for games, simulations, or any system where object reuse improves performance.
- Uses `std::vector<Object>` internally, giving:
  - **Stack behavior** for quick acquire/release (`push_back`, `pop_back`, `back`)
  - **Easy iteration** with range-based for loops:

```cpp
for (auto& obj : pool.getAllObjects()) {
    // Do something with each object
}
```

## Features

- Written as a C++ template: `ObjectPool<Object>`
- Stores inactive objects in a `std::vector<Object>` stack
- `acquire()` gives you a reusable object
- `release(obj)` returns the object to the pool
- Works with any copyable/movable object type

---

## Example Usage

```cpp
#include "ObjectPool.hpp"
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

struct MyObject {
    int id;
    MyObject(int id = 0) : id(id) {}
};

int main() {
    ObjectPool<MyObject> pool;
    //ObjectPool<MyObject> pool{100}; Preallocate 100 objects

    // Acquire an object from the pool
    auto obj = pool.acquire();
    obj->id = 42;
    std::cout << "Using object with id = " << obj->id << std::endl;

    // Return the object to the pool
    pool.release(obj);

    // Re-acquire (reuse) the object
    auto reused = pool.acquire();
    std::cout << "Reused object with id = " << reused->id << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
````

## Example: Iterating Over the Pool

```cpp
for (auto& obj : pool.getAllObjects()) {
    std::cout << obj.id << std::endl;
}
```
---

## How It Works

Internally, the pool uses:

```cpp
std::vector<Object> pool;
```

It works like a **stack**:

* `acquire()` â†’ gets from `back()` and `pop_back()`
* `release(obj)` â†’ adds back using `push_back(obj)`

If the pool is empty, `acquire()` just creates a new object.

## Build Instructions

A **Makefile** is included to simplify compiling the project.

* âœ… Works on **Unix/Linux/macOS**
* âœ… Compatible with **Windows (NT)** using environments like:

  * [MinGW](https://www.mingw-w64.org/)
  * [WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/)
  * [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/)

####  To build:

```bash
make run
```

This will compile the project using `g++` with C++17. You can customize the `Makefile` as needed for your system or compiler.

## Dependencies

The core object pool (`include/ObjectPool.hpp`) is **header-only** and has **no external dependencies**.  

The demo (`demo/` folder) requires 
- [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) (installed via MSYS2 recommended)

On MSYS2 (64-bit MinGW):
```bash
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-sfml
```

## To-Do / Learning Goals

* [ ] Add support for custom object initialization
* [ ] Add thread-safety (maybe with mutex?)
* [ ] Benchmark vs. dynamic allocation
* [ ] Write unit tests
